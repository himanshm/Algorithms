When comparing the use of `forEach` and `for...of` for iterating through an array in TypeScript (or JavaScript), here are some considerations regarding optimization:

Performance
`forEach`:

Slightly slower due to the function call overhead for each iteration.
It's less flexible as it doesn't allow for early termination (e.g., using break or return).
`for...of`:

Generally faster because it directly iterates over the iterable without the overhead of a callback function.
More flexible since you can use control statements like break and continue.
Readability and Usability
`forEach`:
More functional in style and can be cleaner for straightforward transformations or side effects.
`for...of`:
Often considered more readable, especially for straightforward looping logic where you may want to stop or skip iterations.
Conclusion
While `forEach` is perfectly fine for most cases and is quite readable, `for...of` is typically more optimized and offers greater flexibility. In performance-critical code, especially in tight loops or large datasets, you might prefer `for...of`.

`for...of` Loop
Readability: `for...of` loops are more readable and expressive, especially when iterating over arrays or other iterable objects. It clearly conveys that you're iterating through each element.
Less Boilerplate: You donâ€™t need to manage the loop index manually, reducing the chance of errors related to index handling.
Flexibility: It allows for `break`, `continue`, and `return` statements, giving you control over the flow of execution.
Traditional `for` Loop
Performance: Traditional `for` loops can be slightly more performant in specific scenarios because they avoid the overhead of iterating through an iterable directly. This can be particularly noticeable in very large datasets.
Fine Control: They allow for complex indexing and manipulation if you need precise control over how you access elements.


In JavaScript and TypeScript, the `const` keyword means that the variable cannot be reassigned to a different value. However, it does not mean that the value itself is immutable. For arrays and objects, `const` ensures that the reference to the array or object remains constant, but the contents of the array or object can still be modified.

When we declare result as `const` in the fizzBuzz function, we ensure that result always points to the same array, but we can still use methods like `push` to modify the contents of the array.
